=== The Ship
* lit by self-igniting gas lamps (gas pressure pushes a firestone into the side of the pipe)
* lamps have valves next to them as on/off switches

* ship transports cargo from many different companies & people
* cargo is loosely based on east–west trading during the Age of Sail

* looks like a fast, small passenger ship; these are either filled with VIPs and armed to the teeth or full of third class passengers – neither a good target for piracy
* actually has an enormous, semi-secret cargo hold


Why are we sinking?::
The Antagonist executed the following plan:
1. drugged you to make you compliant, brought you to storage B
2. knocked you out
3. took the McGuffin from storage A
4. prepared the fire in storage C (beeswax from storage), opened the grating and the coal store
5. opened and jammed the diving air lock, unlocked all hatches on the way to shaft/storage C
6. lit fire, climbed up shaft towards life boats
7. panic crew and passengers, get away in life boat
