== Character Creation

- your characters have offended someone; they want you dead.
- you're onboard the _Iceberg_â€”are you on the run, employed on the ship, suffering from wanderlust? All three?
- what's your background (see table)?
- you wake up from a drug-induced slumber, trapped in _storage B_.
- flashback appropriate to your background: How do they know what they do?
